This is a small library for creating middleware to handle mobile browsers in compojure applications.

## Usage

To run the example application:

lein dpes
lein repl src/mobile/example.clj

To apply the middleware to your own application:

First define the function that will transform your response, if a mobile device is detected
(defn myfunc ...)

Then apply the middleware:

(wrap! name_of_your_app
       ((handle-mobile myfunc)))

That's it!
